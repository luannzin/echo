# STATE

Last updated: 2026-08-25 · Phase: **0 complete** · Checkpoint: **A — waiting on you**

## Done

### Phase 0 — Skeleton
- Bun workspaces (`apps/*`, `packages/*`, `tooling/*`) + Turborepo task graph (`build`, `dev`,
  `typecheck`, `test`, `clean`).
- Biome as the single lint + format + import-sort tool. Config at `biome.json`, Tailwind CSS
  directives enabled in the CSS parser.
- `tooling/tsconfig` presets: `base`, `library`, `react-library`, `next`. Strict everywhere,
  including `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `verbatimModuleSyntax`.
- Eleven empty-but-valid packages, each with a README stating its single responsibility:
  `types, core, db, search, embeddings, learning, parser, sync, config, ui, test-utils`.
- `apps/web`: Next.js 16 (Turbopack) + Tailwind v4, dark-first token set, three-pane app shell
  (`components/app-shell.tsx`) with honest empty states — no fake notes, no placeholder data.
- Docs: `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (layering + the 10 boundary rules), `docs/PLAN.md`,
  this file. `.claude/launch.json` so the dev server starts the same way every time.

Verified: `bun install` → `bun run typecheck` (12/12) → `bun run lint` (clean) → `bun run build`
(static build OK) → `bun run dev:web` renders the shell at http://localhost:3000 with no console
errors.

Installed versions: bun 1.3.14 · turbo 2.10.11 · biome 2.5.10 · typescript 7.0.2 · next 16.3.3 ·
tailwindcss v4.

## In progress
- Nothing. Stopped at Checkpoint A by design.

## Next
1. **You:** add `AGENTS.md` / house rules, install COSS UI into `packages/ui`, share any visual
   references.
2. **Then Phase 1:** zod contracts in `@echo/types` → PGlite + pgvector + numbered migrations in
   `@echo/db` → repositories → `@echo/core` services and event bus → note list, textarea editor,
   autosave in `apps/web`. Ends at Checkpoint B (data model review).

## Decisions made
| Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-25 | bun workspaces instead of pnpm | user directive |
| 2026-08-25 | Biome instead of ESLint + Prettier | user directive |
| 2026-08-25 | Turborepo kept | user directive, spec §3 |
| 2026-08-25 | Package scope `@echo/*` | project directory is `echo-note` |
| 2026-08-25 | Multilingual embeddings (`multilingual-e5-small`, ~120MB, 384-dim) | notes in pt-BR and any other language; English-only model rejected |
| 2026-08-25 | Plain textarea editor in Phase 1, rich editor later | capture speed first; Notion-style editor is a later upgrade |
| 2026-08-25 | Landing page as a route group inside `apps/web` | one deploy, shared UI primitives |
| 2026-08-25 | Bun's isolated node_modules linker (default in 1.3) | left as-is; Next builds fine under it |

## Open decisions
- Rich editor engine for the post-MVP upgrade (Tiptap/ProseMirror vs BlockNote vs Lexical). Not
  needed until after Phase 2.
- License. README says TBD; permissive is the intent.

## Known gaps / debt
- No test runner wired yet (Vitest lands with Phase 1's first real logic — nothing to test today).
- No CI workflow yet. Cheap to add whenever you want it: `typecheck + lint + build` on push.
- `packages/*/src/index.ts` are `export {}` stubs by design; they fill in from Phase 1 on.
- App shell is desktop-only so far — the mobile layout is Phase 6, and the panes currently just
  hide below `md`/`lg`.
