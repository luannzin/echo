# STATE

Last updated: 2026-08-25 · Phase: **1 complete + capture UX reshaped** · Checkpoint: **B**

Product: **echo** — open source, no-AI note taker that learns with you.

## Done

### Phase 0 — Skeleton
- Bun workspaces (`apps/*`, `packages/*`, `tooling/*`) + Turborepo task graph (`build`, `dev`,
  `typecheck`, `test`, `clean`).
- Biome as the single lint + format + import-sort tool. Config at `biome.json`, Tailwind CSS
  directives enabled in the CSS parser.
- `tooling/tsconfig` presets: `base`, `library`, `react-library`, `next`. Strict everywhere,
  including `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `verbatimModuleSyntax`.
- Eleven empty-but-valid packages, each with a README stating its single responsibility:
  `types, core, db, search, embeddings, learning, parser, sync, config, ui, test-utils`.
- `apps/web`: Next.js 16 (Turbopack) + Tailwind v4, dark-first token set, three-pane app shell
  (`components/app-shell.tsx`) with honest empty states — no fake notes, no placeholder data.
- Docs: `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (layering + the 10 boundary rules), `docs/PLAN.md`,
  this file. `.claude/launch.json` so the dev server starts the same way every time.

Verified: `bun install` → `bun run typecheck` (12/12) → `bun run lint` (clean) → `bun run build`
(static build OK) → `bun run dev:web` renders the shell at http://localhost:3000 with no console
errors.

Installed versions: bun 1.3.14 · turbo 2.10.11 · biome 2.5.10 · typescript 7.0.2 · next 16.3.3 ·
tailwindcss v4.

### Checkpoint A — design system
- coss ui installed into `apps/web` via `shadcn@latest init -b base -p nova` + `add @coss/ui
  @coss/colors-neutral`. All 54 primitives present in `components/ui/`, Base UI under them.
- Registry files (`components/ui/**`, `hooks/use-media-query.ts`, `lib/utils.ts`) excluded from
  Biome — the CLI owns them, hand-edits would be overwritten.
- Brand tokens + dark shell tuning in `app/globals.css`; fonts wired through `next/font`
  (Geist / Geist Mono / Instrument Serif for display).
- Shell rebuilt to the reference direction: 56px icon rail with tooltips, collapsible navigation,
  quiet top bar, intelligence panel. Unbuilt destinations render disabled and name their phase.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` records the direction: loud marketing surface, quiet application surface.

### Phase 1 — Local persistence and note CRUD
- `@echo/types`: zod schemas as the single definition (`Note`, `Folder` + create/update inputs),
  types inferred. `DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_ID` lives here.
- `@echo/db`: PGlite + Drizzle. Schema in `src/schema.ts` (`folders`, `notes`), migrations generated
  by drizzle-kit and inlined into `src/migrations.generated.ts` by `bun run db:generate` so they
  ship to the browser. `migrate()` is versioned, transactional and idempotent, tracked in
  `echo_migrations`.
- `@echo/core`: `createEcho({ repositories })` composition root, typed event bus, note and folder
  services. Titles are derived from content (`deriveTitle`), never asked for. Clock and id factory
  are injected so services test deterministically.
- `apps/web`: `EchoProvider` opens PGlite lazily in the browser (`idb://echo`), note list, textarea
  editor, 500ms debounced autosave with a save indicator, empty states for loading/error/no-notes.
- Tests: 13 passing — `bun test`, no runner dependency. Services against an in-memory repository,
  repositories against a real in-memory PGlite migrated from the real migration files.

Verified in the browser: create note → type → autosave ("Saved") → reload → note and content
survive from IndexedDB, list ordered newest-first, no console errors.

### Capture UX
- Home is a composer, not a document: a big always-focused text area, no "New note" button
  anywhere. Enter commits, Shift+Enter is a new line, and nothing is written to the database before
  the writer commits — no empty notes accumulate.
- Committing opens the saved note in the editor with autosave; Esc or "Back to writing" returns to
  the composer.
- `apps/web` is a **static export** (`output: "export"`) — no server, no hydration mismatch, and
  self-hosting is copying `out/`.
- Writing is never gated on loading: the composer is focused and writable from first paint, and
  `capture` awaits the database itself rather than React state. Committing during a cold start
  works. The note list carries that latency instead, with coss `Skeleton` rows matching the real
  row geometry.
- A prompt is drawn at random per visit and fixed for that visit, so nothing shifts under the
  cursor.
- Saving keeps the writer on the composer and drops a neutral inline alert above it — note title,
  word count, **Continue** to open it, dismiss to ignore. No toast: the confirmation waits to be
  read instead of expiring.
- Opening a note puts the caret after the last character and scrolls to it — opening means
  continuing.
- The rail's pen is Write: it returns home from anywhere and marks itself current.
- No context and no custom hooks: `app/page.tsx` owns notes, selection and the database handle, and
  every component takes plain props. The editor owns its own save state, because nothing else needs
  to know about it.
- Motion tokens (`--ease-out-quart`, `--ease-in-out-quart`, `rise`, `settle`) live in the theme.
  Applied to: heading entrance, list stagger (28ms, first 8 items), save-button scale+fade,
  save-state indicator, focus ring, press feedback. Reduced motion still collapses all of it.

## In progress
- Nothing. Stopped at Checkpoint B.

## Next
1. **You:** review the data model (`packages/db/src/schema.ts`, `packages/types/src/*.ts`) and the
   service surface (`packages/core/src/{notes,folders}.ts`).
2. **Then Phase 2:** rich editor decision, ⌘K command palette, keyboard map, folder explorer with
   nesting and rename, Recent/Inbox routes.

## Decisions made
| Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-25 | bun workspaces instead of pnpm | user directive |
| 2026-08-25 | Biome instead of ESLint + Prettier | user directive |
| 2026-08-25 | Turborepo kept | user directive, spec §3 |
| 2026-08-25 | Product is **echo**, lowercase in prose and UI | user directive; tagline: open source, no-AI note taker that learns with you |
| 2026-08-25 | Multilingual embeddings (`multilingual-e5-small`, ~120MB, 384-dim) | notes in pt-BR and any other language; English-only model rejected |
| 2026-08-25 | Plain textarea editor in Phase 1, rich editor later | capture speed first; Notion-style editor is a later upgrade |
| 2026-08-25 | Landing page as a route group inside `apps/web` | one deploy, shared UI primitives |
| 2026-08-25 | Bun's isolated node_modules linker (default in 1.3) | left as-is; Next builds fine under it |
| 2026-08-25 | coss installed into `apps/web`, not `packages/ui` | only one consumer exists; promoting a primitive is a move, not a rewrite |
| 2026-08-25 | Instrument Serif as the display face | free, high-contrast didone; a licensed face swaps in with one line in `layout.tsx` |
| 2026-08-25 | App is dark-only for now | both app references are dark; light mode is a token swap later |
| 2026-08-25 | Plain `nav` rail instead of coss `Sidebar` | the rail never expands and has no mobile sheet yet; `Sidebar` returns if that changes |
| 2026-08-25 | Drizzle ORM (user directive) | typed queries over one schema definition; drizzle-kit generates migrations |
| 2026-08-25 | Migrations inlined into TS by a script | browsers have no filesystem; regeneration beats hand-copying |
| 2026-08-25 | `bun test` instead of Vitest | same API, zero dependencies, runs real PGlite |
| 2026-08-25 | Schema grows per phase (`folders`, `notes` today) | tables nobody reads are speculative; `workspace_id` is already everywhere |
| 2026-08-25 | Note title derived from first meaningful line | capture must never demand a title dialog |
| 2026-08-25 | Folder deletion returns notes to the Inbox | notes are the user's; organization is not |
| 2026-08-25 | Composer + Enter to commit, no "New" button | capture must be felt, not clicked; nothing is stored until the writer commits |
| 2026-08-25 | Next static export (`output: "export"`) | user directive; the whole app is client-side, so a server only adds hydration risk |
| 2026-08-25 | No view-transition morph between composer and note | tried and dropped on request; the swap stays instant |
| 2026-08-25 | Saving stays on the composer, with an inline alert offering "Continue" | writing sessions are usually a burst of separate thoughts; opening each note would interrupt the next one |
| 2026-08-25 | Inline alert instead of a toast | the confirmation carries an action, so it must not expire on its own |
| 2026-08-25 | No React context, no custom hooks | one owner component and props are enough at this size; state managers stay out until something actually needs them |

## Open decisions
- Rich editor engine for the post-MVP upgrade (Tiptap/ProseMirror vs BlockNote vs Lexical). Not
  needed until after Phase 2.
- License. README says TBD; permissive is the intent.

## Known gaps / debt
- No CI workflow yet. Cheap to add whenever you want it: `typecheck + lint + test + build` on push.
- `search`, `embeddings`, `learning`, `parser`, `sync`, `config`, `ui`, `test-utils` are still
  `export {}` stubs; they fill in from Phase 3 on.
- PGlite runs on the main thread. Fine at this size; move to `@electric-sql/pglite/worker` when
  embeddings start competing for it (marked `ponytail:` in the code).
- Any domain event reloads the whole note list. Fine to ~200 notes, virtualize in Phase 2.
- The composer's grow-to-fit uses a measure-and-set effect. `field-sizing: content` would delete it,
  but Firefox lacks support — revisit when it lands.
- Composer metadata row shows word count today; it is the slot detected categories, tasks and dates
  plug into from Phase 3.
- No projects/tasks tables yet — they arrive with Phase 5, on their own migration.
- App shell is desktop-only so far — the mobile layout is Phase 6, and the panes currently just
  hide below `md`/`lg`.
- Landing page not built yet (Phase 8). The marketing direction is documented and the tokens exist,
  but nothing renders it.
- Product copy carries no roadmap/phase references any more; empty states describe the product,
  not the build order.
